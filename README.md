# PoolTools
Analyse and design surveys with pool-tested data: a Shiny interface to [PoolTestR](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTestR?tab=readme-ov-file#pooltestr) and [PoolPoweR](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolPoweR?tab=readme-ov-file#poolpower).

The latest version of PoolTools (v0.1.5) is available as a web app here: https://caitlinch.shinyapps.io/PoolTools-ICC/
The previous version (v0.1.4) is available here: https://fredjaya.shinyapps.io/pooltools/

PoolTools is documented via the [PoolTools wiki](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTools/wiki). 

To understand the statistical assumptions underlying PoolTools, see the wiki page [Statistical assumptions and default values](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTools/wiki/Statistical-assumptions-and-default-values)

This tool is under construction, with new functionality added often. Though we are confident that implemented code is correct and have provided extensive [documentation](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTools/wiki), the layout and names of options, inputs, and outputs may change over time.
