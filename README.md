# PoolTools
Anlayse and design surveys with pool-tested data: a Shiny interface to [PoolTestR]([url](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTestR?tab=readme-ov-file#pooltestr)) and [PoolPoweR](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolPoweR?tab=readme-ov-file#poolpower).

This tool is under construction, with new functionality added often. Though we are confident that implemented code is correct and have provided extensive [documentation](https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTools/wiki), the layout and names of options, inputs, and outputs may change over time.
